# DB-Utils

[![CI Build](https://github.com/axonivy-market/db-utils/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/axonivy-market/db-utils/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Db-Utils is a collection of tools to help with typical database-tasks in your project.
It comes with support for automatic, incremental SQL updates of database tables, export
and import of data and a simple database query window. Support for Microsoft SQL and HSQLDB is
provided out of the box, but it is easy to extend the component for other database types.

Read our [documentation](db-utils-product/README.md).
