# DB-Utils

[![CI Build](https://github.com/axonivy-market/db-utils/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/axonivy-market/db-utils/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

DB-Utils is a collection of tools to help with typical database-tasks in your project.
It comes with support to implement incremental auto-update of tables, export and import
of data and a simple query GUI.
Support for MS SQL and HSQLDB is provided out of the box, but it is easy to extend the
component for other database types.

Read our [documentation](db-utils-product/README.md).
